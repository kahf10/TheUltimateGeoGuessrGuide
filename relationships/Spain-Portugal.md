## Language: 
*mostly for kahf because manny speaks both Spanish and Portuguese*
The two languages share similar roots and about 90% lexical similarity, but are different. 

Key Differences: (TLDR Portuguese has more letters)
The nasal n
	*Spanish* uses ñ ( think Espa**ñ**a)
	Portuguese uses nh (Ronaldi**nh**o)
	
The /s/ sound
(the reasons why there are different letters depends on a few things outside of the scope of Geoguessr)
	Spanish uses c, z, or s 
	Portuguese uses c, z, s, OR ç (think Curaçao)

Special vowels: 
	Portuguese has a variety of vowel spellings that Spanish does not
		ex: ã, â, à, ô, õ, ê  

## Signs:
Let's take a look at street signs: 

Word-based: 
* Street names will look quite similar. The one street word that is shared is "avenida" so don't use that for help
* easy ways to tell: 
	* rúa - Spanish (Galicia); rua - Portuguese
	* camino - Spanish; caminho - Portuguese
	* calzada - Spanish; calçada - Portuguese
* *estrada* is shared, but only really used by Portuguese
* Spain exclusively uses *calle*
